# DM_NSI_casse_brique
</br>

Here is a quick explanation of the game:
- move the player with Q and D (made for a french keyboard, the controls can be changed at the start of the code file)
- if the ball hits the player on the edge, it will bonce at a different angle
- the ball moves faster as the games goes on
- if the ball touches the bottom of the screen you loose a life

There are three types of bricks:
- blue bricks are normal, the darker the blue the more health the brick has
- orange bricks make the ball bonce in a random direction
- white bricks make the ball go faster

Know bugs:
- the lives system doesn't work properly (sometimes more than one hp is lost)
- if the player moves while the ball hits its side, the ball might get stuck inside the player
- the game crashes if multiple bricks get deleted at the same time
